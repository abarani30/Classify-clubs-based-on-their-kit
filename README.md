## About the project:

i'm trying here to implement the decision tree algorithm in python, decision tree algorithm is a supervised machine learning 
algorithm used mainly for the classfication purposes. My mission here is to classify the clubs based on t-shirt and short, 
so we've a two features: **t-shirt**, **short** and the **clubs** which is our target (The final prediction). In every dataset you
will always look for what you already have (Features Set) and what is the predicted output (The target). 


## Requirements to solve this task (project):

You can work with any of the three options below (You're free to chose any option):

* A **python interpreter** and a professional text editor like **VSCode** installed on your computer. You can 
download the interpreter from [python interpreter](https://python.org) and in the same way try to download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

* An IDE like **PyCharm** which is really great for all type of projects which you might work with it in the future. You can download the community version from [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

* Anconda which is an open-source project and it is consider the birthplace of data science and machine learning in Python and R languages. If you're really caring to dive in deep with this field, so try to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

* A Google Colab which is online platform hosted by google allows you to write and execute Python in your browser. i highly recommend
you to get start with this because at least for this project you don't need to install all the dependencies below cause it comes 
with all configurations that you need to start coding with python!. You can get start here [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com
)

## Dependecies needed to get start with this project:

I know that this is mentioned in the code but i'm here to explaine briefly each one separtely, the dependencies are: 

- **scikit-learn**: It contains all the important machine learning algorithms such as: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, SVM, and so on. scikit-learn is used widely for many purposes such as: Classification, Regression, Clustering and so on, You can read more about it [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and you can also install it using the following command:

  ```pip install scikit-learn```
 
 - **pandas**: It is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool used mainly in data 
 analysis. You can read more about it [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and you can install it using the following command:
 
    ```pip install pandas```
  
 - **pydotplus**: It is used to provides us a graph for our features data after converting it to a binary form (0 and 1). You can install it on your machine using the following command:
 
    ```pip install pydotplus```
  
- **IPython**: It is used as an optional library only to make our job more interactive by displaying the tree algorithm as tree. You can read more about it [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and also you can install it by using the following command:

  ```pip install ipython```
