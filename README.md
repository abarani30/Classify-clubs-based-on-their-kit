# About the project:

i'm trying here to implement the decision tree algorithm in python, decision tree algorithm is a supervised machine learning 
algorithm used mainly for the classfication purposes. My mission here is to classify the clubs based on t-shirt and short, 
so we've a two features: **t-shirt**, **short** and the **clubs** which is our target (The final prediction). In every dataset you
will always look for what you already have (Features Set) and what is the predicted output (The target). 


# Requirements to solve this task (project):

You can work with any of the three options below (You're free to chose any option):

* A **python interpreter** and a professional text editor like **VSCode** installed on your computer. You can 
download the interpreter from [python interpreter](https://python.org) and in the same way try to download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

* An IDE like **PyCharm** which is really great for all type of projects which you might work with it in the future. You can download the community version from [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

* Anconda which is an open-source project and it is consider the birthplace of data science and machine learning in Python and R languages. If you're really caring to dive in deep with this field, so try to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

* A Google Colab which is online platform hosted by google allows you to write and execute Python in your browser. i highly recommend
you to get start with this because at least for this project you don't need to install all the tools below cause it comes with all configurations that you need to start coding with python!. You can get start here [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com
